# Private registry

AlgoFab gives you the possibility to push and pull your images on a private registry available at [<%= config[:algofab_docker] %>](<%= config[:algofab_docker] %>). 

That registry is created from [VMWare Harbor](https://github.com/vmware/harbor) and can allow you to make as much docker images private as possible for free unlike docker's registry (dockerhub). It also comes with features allowing you to grant you privileges to other users thus letting you work on the same image as a team.

To use the private registry go to [<%= config[:algofab_docker] %>](<%= config[:algofab_docker] %>) and log in with the same username / password you use on the Portal. We will explain here how to push / pull images to and from the registry and also how to invite other users to work on the images.

## Create a project :
